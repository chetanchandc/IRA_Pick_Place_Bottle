# IRA_Pick_Place_object
This is a repository for the project named Industrial Robotic Arm(IRA)_Pick_Place_Object. This project is a part of Flexible Automation course - PMAR Lab, Robotics Engineering, during my master's at the University of Genova, Italy.


## Software requirements

* Creo Parametric 5.0.4.0
* Tecnomatix/Process Simulate


## Design
The design of IRA_Pick_Place_Bottle is classified into 3 steps

* Design all the parts and assmeblies(4 bottles, Rotating table to hold 4 holes, and a stationary table to place the bottle) using **creo**.
* Import the above files to **tecnomatix** using JT File conversion.
* Design a simulation using pre-built **IRA** i.e., Simulate the IRA to **pick** one of the bottle on the rotating table and **place** it on the stationary table.


## Video Tutorial
The simulation video of the **IRA** pick and place can be found at the following link.
